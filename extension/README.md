# Chrome extension

This extension has the goal of removing most of the infinite scrolling and reels/short videos from several websites. This is removed without affecting the actual content from friends and liked pages.

An installation guide can be found [at the bottom of this page](#installing):

&nbsp;

## How it works

- The `manifest.json` file runs JavaScript files specific for Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and YouTube when visiting these websites.
- An array of CSS selectors (`selectorArray`) is then created for that specific website.
- In `CSSselectors.js`, the selector array is made into a string. A style element is then prepended to the HTML element of these websites, which hides the elements from the website:

```
$('html').prepend(
    `<style>
    ${stringifiedArray} {
        display: none!important;
    }
    </style>`
);
```

For Facebook, a `MutationObserver` is also added to remove "Suggested for you" and "Reels and short videos" from the feed as soon as these posts load in. Currently this works most of the time, and either works very well or not at all.

## What is removed from each website

### Facebook:

- All Facebook Reels.
- All Facebook Videos.
- All "Suggested for you" and "Reels and short videos" posts in the home feed.
- All sponsored posts.

### Instagram:

- All Instagram Reels.
- The "Explore" page.
- The "Suggested for you" section on the homepage (which has infinite scrolling and shows up after viewing all posts from followed pages).
- "More posts from \_\_\_\_" when viewing a post or a reel.

### TikTok:

- Infinite scrolling on recommended page.

**Note: As the entire concept of TikTok is based on reels and infinite scrolling, I would recommend an extension for blocking this specific website if that is of interest.**

### YouTube:

- All YouTube Shorts.
- Infinite scrolling on the homepage. Hardcoded to 3 rows of videos but can be adjusted by changing `const homePageSections = 3;` to another value in `reels-blocker/extension/youtube.js`.

## Installing:

I primarily made this extension for my own productivity but if testing the code is of interest I have included this installation guide. The installing is based on the top rated answer to [this Stack Overflow question](https://superuser.com/questions/247651/how-does-one-install-an-extension-for-chrome-browser-from-the-local-file-system):

1. Clone this project
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/` in your browser
3. Activate "Developer mode" in the top right corner
4. Click <kbd>Load Unpacked Extension</kbd>
5. Navigate to the local folder containing the extensionâ€™s code (the folder `<your-path>/reels-blocker/extension` in this case) and click Ok
