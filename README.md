# reels-blocker

This project is created to remove reels/short videos from Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and YouTube. This is done in order to save time, improve mental health and boost productivity.

## Web extension

This is a chrome web extension, with all files found in `extension`.

## App

**Currently work in progress.**

The goal is to create an Android app that can either hide reels/short videos or send a reminder to the user when watching these. The app is supposed to work for Facebook Reels, Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts in their respective apps.

As the entire concept of TikTok is these short videos, I am unsure if I am going to try to block short videos here. I would instead recommend blocking the TikTok app entirely using some third party app. Or simply removing the TikTok app.
